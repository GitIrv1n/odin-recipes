            <li>1/2 cup butter, cut into large cubes or slices</li>
            <li>2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
            <li>2 cups freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Make the noodles: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the fettuccine 
                    and cook until al dente according to package directions, usually 10 minutes. 
                    Reserve 1/2 cup of the cooking water, then drain well. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Make the chicken: Season chicken breasts with the Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper.</li>
                <li>Warm the olive oil over medium-high heat in a large nonstick skillet. 
                    Once it’s shimmering, swirl the pan to evenly distribute. Add the chicken 
                    and leave it undisturbed for 5-7 minutes, until the bottom is golden-brown. 
                    Flip over and add in 1 tablespoon of butter between them, picking up the pan 
                    to give it a gentle swirl to distribute. Continue cooking for another 5-7 minutes 
                    (or an internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F.)</li>
                <li>Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let rest for 3 minutes. Cut into
                     1/2-inch-thick slices. Tent with foil while you prepare the sauce.</li>
                <li>Make the Alfredo sauce: In the same pan, over medium-low heat, add the butter 
                    and cream; whisk until butter has melted.</li>
                <li>Add in the minced garlic, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, salt, and 
                    pepper; whisk until combined and smooth.</li>
                <li>Bring to a gentle simmer (do not boil) and cook for 3-4 minutes, whisking 
                    constantly, until it starts to thicken.</li>
                <li>Stir in the parmesan cheese just until melted and the sauce is smooth. 
                    (If the sauce ends up too thick, add some of the reserved pasta cooking water, 
                    a few tablespoons at a time, to thin it out.)</li>
                <li>Assemble: Take sauce off the heat and immediately toss with the cooked fettuccine noodles.</li>
                <li>Divide the pasta among serving bowls and top with a few slices of chicken. Garnish with parsley, 
                    more parmesan, and black pepper if desired.</li>
            </ol>
