    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Birria is a traditional stew from Jalisco, Mexico, known for its deep, rich flavor.
       It is typically made by slow cooking goat or lamb in a seasoned broth until the 
       meat is tender. The dish is served with a warm consomé and garnished with fresh 
       cilantro and white onion.Although birria is often associated with tacos today, it 
       was originally enjoyed as a stew. Its warmth and bold flavor make it especially 
       satisfying on colder days.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dried chiles and/or peppers</li>
            <li>Mexican oregano</li>
            <li>Mexican cinnamon</li>
            <li>Cuts of meat</li>
        </ul>
    </p>


    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <p><strong>Prepare the birria:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring meat to room temperature and then salt it liberally.</li>
            <li>In a large pot that has an oven-proof lid, place it over medium-high heat. 
                You’re probably going to have to do this in batches, but sear the meat on 
                both sides for about 3 minutes per side. Transfer the meat to a bowl and 
                then repeat with the remaining pieces of meat.</li>
            <li>Then you’re add the chiles, tomatoes, onions, spices and garlic to a pot. 
                Cover the chiles and everything with water and simmer for about 20 minutes. 
                We want the tomatoes and chiles very softened.</li>
            <li>Drain it and then transfer everything to a blender, along with a cup or two 
                of beef broth or water. Blend it up until super smooth.</li>
            <li>Add the meat back to the large pot and pour the sauce over it. Pour 1 cup of 
                broth in the blender and swish it back in forth (to pick up any extra sauce) 
                and pour it into the pot. Bring it to a gentle simmer and then cover. Transfer 
                the pot to the oven to braise for about 3 to 3 1/2 hours, until the meat shreds easily.</li>
        </ol>

    <p><strong>Prepare the birria tacos:</strong></p>
         <ol>
                <li>Remove the meat from the sauce and shred it with two forks.</li>
                <li>Add some of the sauce (the consomé) to a bowl and add a little
                     beef broth if it needs to be thinned out.</li>
                <li>Mince up some onion and cilantro and mix it in a small bowl with a 
                    few squeezes of lime and a pinch of salt.</li>
                <li>Add a spoonful of the cilantro and onion mixture to the consomé and add 
                    a squeeze of lime.</li>
                <li>Dip a corn tortilla into the top of the sauce. This should be mostly fat. 
                    And add it to a non-stick skillet, set over medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>Flip over and then add a small handful of shredded meat and a handful of Oaxacan 
                    cheese. Shape it into a quesadilla/taco. And flip it over so it can get crispy 
                    and melty on the other side.</li>
                <li>Transfer to a baking sheet and place in a 200F oven while you work your way through 
                    the rest of the Birria tacos.</li>
            </ol>
